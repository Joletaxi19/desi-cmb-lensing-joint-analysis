# MaPar

A general framework to go from Maps to Parameters.

# Installation

To install `MaPar` run `bash setup.sh`. Doing so will install all required dependencies:

`numpy`, `scipy`, `CLASS`, `velocileptors`, ...

[`CLASS`](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) is used to compute CMB anisotropies and the linear matter power spectrum. 

[`velocileptors`](https://github.com/sfschen/velocileptors) is used to compute the the redshift-space power spectrum of a general biased tracer to 1-loop order in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory.
