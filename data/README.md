This directory contains scripts for making auxillary data, as well as some of the auxillary data.

fetch_dNdz.py creates the files starting with LRG_dNdz. These are the redshift distributions of the LRG samples as measured by DESI spectroscopy in different regions. North corresponds to BASS+MzLS, while South is DECaLS+DES. 

Files ending with nlkk_filt.txt are CMB lensing noise curves after low-pass filtering ell>2500.
