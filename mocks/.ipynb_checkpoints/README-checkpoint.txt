Code to create mock data for covariances, foreground bias estimation, etc.

To create LRG mocks from the WebSky catalog, run the following (all from within the MaPar/mocks directory): fetch_WebSky_halos.sh, make_WebSky_LRG_subcatalogs.py, and make_WebSky_LRG_mocks.py. The mocks will have names like mock_lrg_s01_del.hpx2048.fits.
