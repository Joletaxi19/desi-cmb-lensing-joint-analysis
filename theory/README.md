limber.py is used to compute Ckg, Cgg. The power spectrum prediction (Pgm, Pgg, Pmm) isn't built in, and is designed to be modular (e.g. can swap out velocileptors for HEFT quite easily). The same is true for the background prediction.

pkCodes.py contains several methods to compute Pgm, Pmm, Pgg

background.py contains several methods to computed background quantities relevant for Limber integration
